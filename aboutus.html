		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The Lions Club was founded in 1917 by Melvin Jones, a Chicago-based insurance agent who believed that individuals should use their talents to improve their communities and the world. His vision led to the creation of a service-focused organization, which quickly gained traction. The first Lions Club meeting was held in Dallas, Texas, and within a few years, it expanded beyond the United States to become an international movement.
		A pivotal moment in Lions Club history came in 1925, when Helen Keller addressed the International Convention and challenged members to become "knights of the blind in the crusade against darkness." This call to action inspired Lions to make vision care and blindness prevention a cornerstone of their mission, a commitment that continues today.

With projects spanning health care, disaster relief, hunger alleviation, and youth development, the Lions Club remains a driving force for positive change, all guided by their"</p>
